# Crpto
Crypto Project

This Project is Provided by Microsoft under the course "Learn To Program in Java".
Crypto Project is mostly related to Encryption and Decryption of Text using String Manipulation and its methods.
Part 1 of the project involves Normalising the text i.e removing the spaces and punctuations from the text and converting all lower case letter into Upper case Letter.
Part 2 involves Obifying the Normalised text i.e inserting "OB" prior to every Vowels and 'Y's in the Text.
Part 3 is based on an important concept known as Caesar Cipher that involves "Shifting" each individual  character forward by a certain Shift value or key. E.g Caesarify("CRYPTO",2) will convert "CRYPTO" to "ETARVQ".
Part 4 involves Groupifying the Cyphertexted String into group of size letters.
Part 5 involves combining the above methods to Encrypt the given String (Text).
And finally a method to Decrypt The Encrypted String using methods such as UnGroupify, UnCaesarify, UnObify.
